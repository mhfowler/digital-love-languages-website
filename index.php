<p>ðŸ¦‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the online hub of Digital Love Languages, a 10 week online class at the <a href="https://sfpc.io/digitallove-spring2020/">School for Poetic Computation</a> stewarded by Melanie Hoff, Max Fowler, Adina Glickstein, and Amber Officer-Narvasa.<br />  <br />
	ðŸ¦‹&nbsp;&nbsp;As our daily activities and closest relationships become increasingly bound up with corporate systems of surveillance and exploitation, letâ€™s explore and cultivate code as a love language that can be gentle, healing, and intimate. How do we want to live in a post COVID-19 world, and what role do we want technology to play? Digital Love Languages: Codes of Affirmation is a class about building poetic tools for online communion through a re-introduction to computers. This class is also a call to action for expanding computationâ€™s capacity for fostering interdependence and feeling.</p>

<p>ðŸ¦‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Together we will build small and personal software for affirming one another across physical distance. Technology will be unpacked as a social process, not only a logic or material, regarding code as a craft and medium capable of expressing the full range of feeling and desire.</p>

<p>ðŸ¦‹&nbsp;&nbsp;This course covers the building blocks of programming and natural language processing using Python & Javascript in the browser. Networks of people and computers become fertile sites for ambient and playful communication. We will look to the history of the love letter as a form, from the&nbsp;<em class="special">quill</em>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<em class="special">sext</em>.<br />
Through coding with langugage and in the browser, we can facilitate a kind of care that happens in small moments of routine.</p>
